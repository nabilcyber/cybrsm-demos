Brief config notes for using Conjur authn-jwt with Azure AD-registered applications.
Jody Hunt	26 Feb 2022

GOAL: Use the appid claim in an Azure JWT to uniquely identify authorized applications for access to secrets in Conjur. This will typically be a user-facing application, where the user authenticates with an oauth2 workflow resulting in a short-lived Azure AD JWT specific to the application. The value of the appid claim is invariant across users. This serves to separate user identities from the application identity, and share the application's access to resources.

DESIGN NOTES:

  As of Conjur 12.5, the authn-jwt variable 'identity-path' is specific to an authn-jwt endpoint. This requires that every unique identity path requires its own authn-jwt endpoint (or all identities share the same path). This is a serious policy design limitation that will hopefully be remedied in a future version.

AZURE AD JWT OVERVIEW:

  Azure AD supports two versions of OAuth2 tokens that can be identified by their headers or the version claim in their bodies.

  Azure AD v1 Token header:
    {
      "typ": "JWT",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "x5t": "i6lGk3FZzxRcUb2C3nEQ7syHJlY",
      "kid": "i6lGk3FZzxRcUb2C3nEQ7syHJlY"
    }

  Azure AD v2 Token header:
    {
      "typ": "JWT",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "kid": "i6lGk3FZzxRcUb2C3nEQ7syHJlY"
    }

  The JWKS endpoint for validating an Azure AD JWT is dependent on its version:
    Azure AD V1 - https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/keys     
    Azure AD V2 - https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/v2.0/keys


  Example decoded header & payload from V1 JWT for Azure AD-registered app:
    {
      "typ": "JWT",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "x5t": "nOo3ZDrODXEK1jKWhXslHR_KXEg",
      "kid": "nOo3ZDrODXEK1jKWhXslHR_KXEg"
    }.
    {
      "aud": "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000",
      "iss": "https://sts.windows.net/c73bf3ef-87e9-48e0-ac85-9c723e6cca39/",
      "iat": 1628260603,
      "nbf": 1628260603,
      "exp": 1628264503,
      "aio": "E2ZgYLhR6va79fxDvunTZ7F9bv5TCQA=",
      "appid": "463be88f-d6af-4264-b3a2-048e5c3d9ea7",	<-- AD-registered application UUID
      "appidacr": "1",
      "idp": "https://sts.windows.net/c73bf3ef-87e9-48e0-ac85-9c723e6cca39/",
      "oid": "2e048c01-7ffb-4683-9eaf-7357dbd00deb",
      "rh": "0.AVgA7_M7x-mH4EishZxyPmzKOY_oO0av1mRCs6IEjlw9nqdYAAA.",
      "sub": "2e048c01-7ffb-4683-9eaf-7357dbd00deb",
      "tenant_region_scope": "NA",
      "tid": "c73bf3ef-87e9-48e0-ac85-9c723e6cca39",	<-- Azure tenant UUID
      "uti": "JJPmvwQQ2kaVFTdL0UFDAg",
      "ver": "1.0"					<-- JWT version format (see above)
    }

  Example of a minimal Conjur policy for authn-jwt endpoint and Conjur host to authenticate using above JWT:

---
# authn-jwt endpoint 
- !policy
  id: conjur/authn-jwt/<endpoint-id>	<-- endpoint ID can be any string, e.g. azure-ad
  body:
   - !variable issuer			<-- set to https://sts.windows.net/<tenant-id>

					    Note that doc says this is an optional field,
					    but that is apparently not the case for Azure AD.

   - !variable jwks-uri			<-- set to V1 or V2 endpoint
					    - https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/keys
					    - https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/v2.0/keys

   - !variable token-app-property	<-- set to "appid" (actual name of claim, not UUID)

   - !variable identity-path		<-- not needed if host id policy is at root
					    otherwise path from policy root to host id
					    (see design note above)

# host identity is the UUID value in the appid claim
- !host
  id: 463be88f-d6af-4264-b3a2-048e5c3d9ea7			<-- value of "appid" claim
  annotations:
    authn-jwt/aadv1/appid: 463be88f-d6af-4264-b3a2-048e5c3d9ea7	<-- value of "appid" claim
