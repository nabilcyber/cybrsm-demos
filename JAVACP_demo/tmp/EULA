1.	GRANT OF LICENSE
1.1.	Software License. Subject to payment of all applicable fees set forth in the Order or payment in accordance with an Indirect Order through a Channel Partner (as appropriate) and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, CyberArk grants Customer a perpetual (or as indicated otherwise in the Order) non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use (and to permit the Authorized Users to use) the Software and the Documentation solely for Customer's and its Affiliates' internal business purposes in accordance with the Documentation and in the quantity specified in the Order. Customer will operate the Software in accordance with the Documentation and be responsible for the acts and omissions of its Authorized Users. Customer may make a reasonable number of copies of any Documentation and one archival copy of the Software. Except for the licenses granted under this Agreement, all rights, title, and interest in and to the Software and Documentation are hereby reserved by CyberArk, its Affiliates or licensors.
1.2.	Restrictions on Use. Customer shall not (directly or indirectly): (a) copy or reproduce the Software or the Documentation except as permitted under this Agreement; (b) exceed the licensed quantities, users or other entitlement measures of the Software as set forth in the applicable Order; (c) remove or destroy any copyright, trademark or other proprietary marking or legends placed on or contained in the Software or Documentation; (d) assign, sell, resell, sublicense, rent, lease, time-share, distribute or otherwise transfer the rights granted to Customer under this Agreement to any third party except as expressly set forth herein; (e) modify, reverse engineer or disassemble the Software; (f) except to the limited extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction, decompile, attempt to derive the source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of any part of the Software, attempt to recreate the Software or use the Software for any competitive purpose; (g) create, translate or otherwise prepare derivative works based upon the Software or Documentation; (h) use the Software to infringe on the Intellectual Property rights, publicity rights, or privacy rights of any third party, or to store or transfer defamatory, trade libelous or otherwise unlawful data; or (i) send, store or process in the Software any personal health data, credit card data, personal financial data or other such sensitive regulated data not required by the Documentation.

2.	PAYMENT AND TAXES
2.1.	Payment Terms. Customer shall pay all invoices within thirty (30) days of date of invoice, without any deduction or set-off (except for any amount disputed promptly and in writing by Customer in good faith), and payment will be sent to the address specified by CyberArk. Any amounts arising in relation to this Agreement not paid when due will be subject to a late charge of one and one-half percent (1.5 %) per month on the unpaid balance or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is less. Without prejudice to Customer's rights set out elsewhere in this Agreement, all Software fees are non-refundable and payable in advance. CyberArk may invoice for purchases of Software upon delivery.
2.2.	Taxes. The fees and charges covered by this Agreement are exclusive of any Indirect Taxes imposed or levied, currently or in the future based on applicable legislation, on the Software. Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, Customer will be liable for compliance with reporting and payment of such Indirect Taxes in its tax jurisdiction. CyberArk shall include the Indirect Taxes on its invoice to Customer and remit such Indirect Taxes collected to the relevant authority if required by applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, CyberArk will be responsible for direct taxes imposed on CyberArk's net income or gross receipts in its tax jurisdiction.

3.	INDIRECT ORDERS. If Customer places an Indirect Order, then CyberArk grants the rights described in this Agreement in consideration for and subject to: (a) Customer's agreement to comply with the pricing and payment terms of the Indirect Order, to be separately agreed between Customer and the applicable Channel Partner; and (b) Customer's agreement to comply with its obligations set forth in this Agreement (including the restrictions on use of the Software). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the final sales price or rate shall be freely and independently determined between the applicable Channel Partner and Customer. For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of such an Indirect Order, any indication in this Agreement of an agreement between Customer and CyberArk for the price payable by Customer for such Indirect Order shall be null and void and not form a binding part of this Agreement and the provisions of this Agreement related to payment terms, pricing and/or order procedures shall not apply.

4.	CONFIDENTIALITY
4.1.	Confidential Information. The Parties acknowledge that each may disclose certain valuable confidential and proprietary information to the other. The receiving Party may only use the disclosing Party's Confidential Information to fulfil the purposes of this Agreement. The receiving Party will protect the disclosing Party's Confidential Information by using at least the same degree of care as the receiving Party uses to protect its own Confidential Information of a like nature (but no less than a reasonable degree of care) to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination, disclosure or publication of such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its (and its Affiliates') employees, advisors, consultants, and agents on a need-to-know basis and provided that such party is bound by obligations of confidentiality substantially similar to those contained herein.
4.2.	Exclusions. Information will not be deemed Confidential Information if it: (i) is known to the receiving Party prior to receipt from the disclosing Party directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; (ii) becomes known (independently of disclosure by the disclosing Party) to the receiving Party directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; (iii) becomes publicly known or otherwise ceases to be secret or confidential, except through a breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving Party without use of or reliance upon the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, and the receiving Party can provide evidence to that effect. The receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to the requirements of a court, governmental agency or by operation of law but shall (to the extent permissible by law) limit such disclosure to only the information requested and give the disclosing Party prior written notice sufficient to permit the disclosing Party to contest such disclosure. This Section supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties with respect to Confidential Information and is a complete and exclusive statement thereof.

6.4.	Remedies. If the Software becomes, or CyberArk reasonably determines that the Software is likely to become, subject to a claim of intellectual property infringement for which CyberArk must indemnify Customer as described above, CyberArk may at its option and expense: (a) procure for Customer the right to continue to access and use the Software; (b) replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing without causing a material adverse effect on the functionality provided by the infringing Software; or (c) if neither of the foregoing options are available in a timely manner on commercially reasonable terms, remove the infringing part of the Software, and refund to Customer (either directly or through a Channel Partner, as applicable): (i) for perpetual Software, the license fee paid for the infringing part of the Software, less an amount equal to one sixtieth (1/60) of the license fee for each full month of the license term prior to the date of removal; or (ii) for subscription based Software, the pro-rated unused portion of any prepaid license subscription fees for the infringing part of the applicable Software, calculated from the date of removal termination of the applicable Order through the remaining subscription term as calculated on a monthly basis.

Nothing herein shall derogate from mandatory rights Customer may have under any OSS Licenses, if any.

8.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

In addition, a Party may terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, or cease provision of maintenance and support services and professional services or Customer's access to the applicable Software if required to comply with applicable law or regulation, and such termination will not constitute a breach of this Agreement by the terminating Party. CyberArk reserves the right to suspend any applicable maintenance and support services and professional services or Customer's access to the applicable Software upon 30 days' written notice to Customer if: (i) an invoice is more than sixty (60) days past due; or (ii) if there is an uncured material breach of this Agreement.

Customer assumes all risks and all costs associated with its use of the Trial Version. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy in case of any dissatisfaction or CyberArk's breach of the Agreement with respect to such Trial Version is termination of the license for the Trial Version. Any obligations on behalf of CyberArk to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless under this Agreement are not applicable to Customer's use of a Trial Version.
